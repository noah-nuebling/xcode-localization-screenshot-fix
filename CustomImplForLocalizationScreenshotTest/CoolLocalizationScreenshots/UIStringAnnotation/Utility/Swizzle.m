/// Discussion:
///
/// Why use the `InterceptorFactory` pattern?
///     When swizzling, after your swizzled method (we call it the `interceptor`) is called, you normally always want to call the original implementation of the method which was intercepted.
///     The usual pattern for intercepting a method with name `-[methodName]`, is to define a method `-[swizzled_methodName]`, and then swap the implementations of the two.
///     Then to invoke the original implementation inside the interceptor, you'd call `[self swizzled_methodName]` (which invokes the original implementation of `[self methodName]` since the two implementations have been swapped) .
///     However, this does not invoke the original implementation in all cases.
///     For example, if your interceptor is invoked from a subclass with a `[super methodName]` call, and the subclass also has an implementation for `[swizzled_methodName]` then `[self swizzled_methodName]` would be invoking the original implementation on the subclass.
///
///     This stuff lead to really complicated issues in the implementation of `swizzleMethodOnClassAndSubclasses()`. (We deleted the detailed notes on that, I think in commit fc3064033f974c454aebb479f20bb0cc3d0eebb6)
///
///     I've thought about the problem quite a bit and I think the only way to reliably get a reference to the original implementation, is to store a reference to the original implementation directly inside the interceptor function. You can't dynamically figure it out without extra information.
///         (I tried a weird appraoch with counting recursions on the interceptor to infer `super` invokations and then find the right implementation  which worked pretty well but was complicated and broke for actually recursive functions. I don't think it's possible to find a robust solution.)
///     Thatt's where the InterceptorFactory comes in. The swizzling code passes the originalImplementation (and some other metadata) to the InterceptorFactory which then creates an Interceptor function that can reliably call its original implementation. - And then the swizzling code replaces the original implementation with the Interceptor.
///
///     Such an InterceptorFactory is quite tedious to write, since you'd have to write all the arguments and types again and again and declare complicated objc blocks. But that's what the MakeInterceptorFactory() macro is for! It provides a clean syntax.
///
///     We have to make it a macro, not a function I think. since the compiler needs to be aware of the argument number and types and stuff. I don't remember. But I tried dynamically parsing the arguments and passing them on to the original implementation from inside the interceptor but it didn't work. varargs didn't work. All the arguments were in weird registers. You'd have to like hardcode knowledge about the calling convention to do this. So we have to declare the interceptor method and its factory with the right types and argument number at compile time. And making that easier is only possible with a macro (I think? I don't remember exactly.)
